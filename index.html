                thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best and most grueling

              "Before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a line of code. I
              needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
              programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
              program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
              were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance.
              The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
              learning t o the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
              have, in fact, i've offer referred to it during interviews as an
              example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
              job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
              100% recommend!"
